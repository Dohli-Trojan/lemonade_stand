# lemonade_stand
First challenge from w3schools - https://discord.gg/6Z7UaRbUQM




Concept:

Player -> the owner of the lemonade stand. <br>
Goal -> make money. How? -> lemonade creation and selling. <br>
Mechanic -> day-by-day cycle. <br>
Number of customers -> dependent on the weather. <br>
Day cycle -> can start off with 1 / 2 types of weather. Weather is showed to user: <br>
Good weather -> more customers will show up – will to pay more. <br>
Bad weather -> less customers will show up – will to pay less. <br>
Buying lemons -> player can buy lemons at an X price. Can be used the next day, if not used on the initial day. <br>
Making lemonade -> player can convert lemons into lemonade. Z to Y ratio. Can choose how many lemons to use, I.e., how much to make.  <br>
Customer calculation -> construct a formula that takes price & weather into consideration. <br>
Bonus -> customer might leave tips – random chance. <br>
End of the day -> the following must happen: <br>
Deletion of lemonade -> all leftover lemonade glasses should be deleted. <br>
Update -> any remaining lemons should become one day old. From 0 to 1. <br>
Deletion of lemons -> all lemons that are 1 <= old should be deleted. <br>
New day -> the whole cycle repeats again.  <br> <br>
